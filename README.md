# Konphig
Config files for safe keeping üòè

This repo contains various configuration files so they don't have to be recreated. They are designed for Linux environments but most will work in MacOS as well.

## Install
This will install all of the configuration files from Konphig to your system (**and overwrite any you already have!**). Use the following steps:
1. `git clone git@github.com:wcarhart/Konphig.git`
2. `cd Konphig/`
3. `./install.sh`
4. `source ~/.bashrc`

From now on, you can use `sb` instead of `source ~/.bashrc` to manually push updates to your system configurations.

In addition, if you ever make a change to any of your Konphig files, you can simply run [`update`](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig/blob/master/functions.md#update) to update your system files (make sure the changed file is in `~/Konphig/`). `update` dynamically matches your system files to your Konphig files and sources them for you automatically.

## Overview
 * [BASH](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig#bash)
 * [git](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig#git)
 * [vim](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig#vim)
 * [tmux](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig#tmux)
 
### BASH
The BASH configurations contain the general `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files, but also:
 * `.bash_functions` - **70+ COOL BASH FUNCTIONS!** - file for BASH functions ([see here](https://github.com/wcarhart/Konphig/blob/master/functions.md) for separate BASH function documentation)
 * `.bash_aliases` - file for BASH aliases
 * `.bash_variables` - file for BASH variables

`BASH` configurations adhere to the following architecture:
```
.bashrc
| | | |
| | | .bash_profile
| | .bash_functions  (where functions are saved)
| .bash_aliases      (where aliases are saved)
.bash_variables      (where variables are saved)
```

### git
Basic `git` configurations, also including some helpful `git` aliases.

### vim
Basic setup for `vim`.

### tmux
Single setting for `tmux`.
